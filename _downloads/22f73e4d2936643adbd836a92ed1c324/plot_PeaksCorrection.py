"""
Detecting and correcting artefacts in peaks vector
==================================================

This example describes artefacts correction peaks vectors.

The function `correct_rr()` automatically detect artefacts using the method proposed
by Lipponen & Tarvainen (2019) [#]_. At each iteration, extra and missed 
peaks are corrected replacement or removal of peaks. The detection procedure is run 
again using cleaned intervals. When using this method, the signal length stays constant,
which makes it more appropriate for event-related designs where the occurrence of 
certain events must be controlled.

# correction method. This function will automatically detect possible artefacts in the 
# peaks vector and reconstruct the most coherent values using time series interpolation. 
# The number of iteration is set to `2` by default, we add it here for clarity. Here, 
# the `correct_peaks` function only correct for extra and missed peaks. This feature is 
# intentional and reflects the notion that only artefacts in R peaks detection should 
# be corrected, but "true" intervals that are anomaly shorter or longer should not be

# for the quality of the artefacts correction is to compare the evoked responses 
# measured under corrupted, corrected and baseline recording. Here, we will use the 
# `plot_evoked` function, which simply take the indexes of events as input together 
# with the recording (here the peaks vector), and produce the evoked plots.

# Merge the two conditions together.
