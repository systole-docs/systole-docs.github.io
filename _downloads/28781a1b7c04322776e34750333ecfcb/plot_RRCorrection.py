Detecting and correcting artefacts in RR time series
====================================================

This example describes artefacts correction in RR time series.

The function `correct_rr()` automatically detect artefacts using the method proposed
by Lipponen & Tarvainen (2019) [#]_. At each iteration, shorts, extra, long, missed 
and ectopic beats are corrected using interpolation of the RR time series, and the
detection procedure is run again using cleaned intervals. Importantly, when using 
this method the signal length can be altered after the interpolation, introducing 
misalignement with eg. triggers from the experiment. For this reason, it is only 
recommended to use it in the context of "bloc design" study or heart rate variability.
