Outliers and ectobeats correction
=================================

Here, we describe two method for artefacts and outliers correction, after
detection using the method proposed by Lipponen & Tarvainen (2019) [#]_.


.. code-block:: default


    # Author: Nicolas Legrand <nicolas.legrand@cfin.au.dk>
    # Licence: GPL v3

    # Two approaches for artefacts correction are proposed:
    # * `correct_peaks()` will find and correct artefacts in a boolean peaks
    # vector, thus ensuring the length of recording remain constant and corrected
    # peaks fit the signal sampling rate. This method is more adapted to
    # event-related cardiac activity designs.

    # * `correct_rr()` will find and correct artefacts in the RR time series. The
    # signal length will possibly change after the interpolation of long, short or
    # ectopic beats. This method is more relevant for HRV analyse of long recording
    # where the timing of experimental events is not important.
